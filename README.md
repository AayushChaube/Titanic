# Real Life Case Study: Titanic Data Analysis
Analyzing Titanic case study using logistics regression - a predictive machine learning model. The dataset consists of various information regarding the passenger detail (Ticket Number, Sex, Name, Parch, Emarch, Age, Class, etc.). Using appropriate columns of the data, proper analysis is performed.

## Logistic Regression
Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis. Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.
Unlike Linear regression, logistic regression can lead us to only two answers yes or no. This is achieved using a sigmoid curve.
The aim of a sigmoid function is to represent all the data from [-infinte, +infinite] in the range of 0 to 1. Also, to achieve the results, Logistic regression uses the concept of threshold.

### Steps in Logistic Regression:
1. Collecting Data
2. Analyzing Data
3. Data Wrangling
4. Train & Test
5. Check Accuracy
